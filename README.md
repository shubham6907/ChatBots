# ChatBots
Simple Python code examples for different kind of chat bots.

### What is a chatbot?
A ChatBot is a kind of virtual assistant that can build conversations with human users! A Chatting Robot. Building a chatbot is one of the popular tasks in Natural Language Processing.

### Are all chatbots the same?
Chatbots fall under three common categories:
1. Rule-based chatbots
2. Retrieval-based chatbots
3. Intelligent chatbots

### Rule-based chatbots
These bots respond to users' inputs based on certain pre-specified rules. For instance, these rules can be defined as if-elif-else statements. While writing rules for these chatbots, it is important to expect all possible user inputs, else the bot may fail to answer properly. Hence, rule-based chatbots do not possess any cognitive skills.

### Retrieval-based chatbots
These bots respond to users' inputs by retrieving the most relevant information from the given text document. The most relevant information can be determined by Natural Language Processing with a scoring system such as cosine-similarity-score. Though these bots use NLP to do conversations, they lack cognitive skills to match a real human chatting companion.

### Intelligent AI chatbots
These bots respond to users' inputs after understanding the inputs, as humans do. These bots are trained with a Machine Learning Model on a large training dataset of human conversations. These bots are cognitive to match a human in conversing. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri fall under this category. Further, most of these bots can make conversations based on the preceding chat texts.
